### What is the CanSat Competition?
**Q: What is the CanSat Competition?**  
A: The CanSat Competition is a design-build-fly competition organized by the American Astronomical Society. It simulates the lifecycle of an aerospace system project, where teams design, build, and test a small satellite (CanSat) that performs a specified mission.

### Team and Participation
**Q: How many teams can participate from one school?**  
A: Each school can submit up to three teams. If more than three teams apply, only the first three applications will be accepted.

**Q: How are teams selected for the competition?**  
A: During the application phase, teams submit an application and a $200 non-refundable fee. Up to 20 teams per country can participate, and from these, the top 40 teams are selected, with at least 20 teams from the US.

### Competition Phases
**Q: What are the phases of the competition?**  
A: The competition consists of five phases:
1. **Application Phase**: Teams submit applications and pay the fee.
2. **Preliminary Design Review (PDR)**: Teams develop initial designs and present PDR slides.
3. **Critical Design Review (CDR)**: Teams finalize designs, order components, and prepare for the launch.
4. **Launch Weekend**: Teams undergo a Flight Readiness Review, perform the launch, and ensure the CanSat meets all mission requirements.
5. **Post Flight Review (PFR)**: Teams present flight results and answer questions.

**Q: What happens during the Preliminary Design Review (PDR)?**  
A: Teams develop designs, prototype, test concepts, and generate a PDR slide package. The slides are submitted by a designated due date and reviewed via telecon.

**Q: What is the Critical Design Review (CDR)?**  
A: During the CDR, teams finalize their designs, start ordering components, manufacturing parts, testing subsystems, and developing the flight unit. A CDR slide package is submitted and reviewed.

**Q: What occurs during the Launch Weekend?**  
A: Teams present their CanSat for the Flight Readiness Review (FRR), perform the launch, and complete final preparations. The launch occurs, and teams must ensure their CanSat meets all mission requirements.

**Q: What is the Post Flight Review (PFR)?**  
A: Teams present the flight results in a 15-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes for questions. Awards are presented based on performance.

### Mission Requirements
**Q: What is the mission for the 2024 competition?**  
A: The 2024 mission simulates a space probe entering a planetary atmosphere. The CanSat must function as a nose cone during ascent, deploy a heat shield after deployment, release a parachute at 100 meters altitude, and carry a large hen's egg that must survive the entire flight intact.

**Q: What are the operational requirements for the CanSat?**  
A: Key operational requirements include:
- Functioning as a nose cone during rocket ascent.
- Deploying from the rocket and deploying a heat shield/aero-braking mechanism.
- Releasing a parachute at 100 meters altitude.
- Carrying a large hen's egg safely through the flight.

**Q: What sensors must be included in the CanSat?**  
A: The CanSat must include sensors for tracking altitude, internal temperature, battery voltage, GPS position, tilt sensor for stability verification, pitot tube for speed measurement, and a video camera capturing the horizontal view during ascent and landing.

### Technical Details
**Q: What are the electrical requirements for the CanSat?**  
A: Key electrical requirements include:
- No lithium polymer batteries allowed.
- Use of alkaline, Ni-Cad, Ni-MH, or Lithium batteries.
- Easily accessible power switch and power indicator.
- Operation for a minimum of two hours when integrated into the rocket.

**Q: What are the telemetry requirements?**  
A: The CanSat must use XBEE radios for telemetry, transmitting data once per second. The telemetry must include altitude, air pressure, temperature, battery voltage, probe tilt angles, air speed, command echo, and GPS coordinates.

### Competition Logistics
**Q: What is the cost limit for the CanSat?**  
A: The cost of the CanSat must be under $1000, excluding ground support and analysis tools. Equipment from previous years must be included at current market value.

**Q: What happens if a team misses a submission deadline?**  
A: Late submissions are not accepted for any phase, and the team will be dropped from the competition.

**Q: What are the rules for the launch day?**  
A: Teams must present their CanSat for the Flight Readiness Review, pass various tests (drop test, fit check, battery verification), and be ready for launch by the designated time. Multiple attempts at the drop test are allowed until the reviews are completed. Second flights are allowed only if the fault is with the launch provider.

### Awards and Recognition
**Q: How are awards determined?**  
A: Awards are based on the performance during the competition, including design reviews, flight performance, and post-flight presentations. Scoring is primarily quantitative to minimize biases.

**Q: What do teams receive upon successful completion of the competition?**  
A: Teams that complete all phases receive certificates of accomplishment and are considered for various awards.
